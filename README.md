Attached is the final presentation and report for our teams senior design capstone project, as well as a video trailer made by one of our team members. We were part of an interdisciplinary team with mechanical engineering, and finished in 1st place for our capstaone competition. My job was to work on the graphical user interface, communication architecture, and the motor/temperature system.
